# Face-Mask-Detection-Using-CNN
The Face Mask Detection project is a deep learning-based system designed to automatically detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that processes facial images and classifies them into two categories: “With Mask” and “Without Mask.”
